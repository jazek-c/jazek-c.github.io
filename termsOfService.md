PRESHIFTER LLC’S TERMS OF SERVICE
INTRODUCTION
Welcome to PreShifter, a comprehensive app designed specifically for the restaurant industry to streamline team communications, daily operational updates, and task management. PreShifter enables restaurant managers, owners, and staff to collaborate effectively through team administrative tools, real-time messaging, pre-shift operation builders, and menu management capabilities. Whether assigning tasks, publishing important announcements, or enhancing operational efficiency, PreShifter offers an integrated platform to improve restaurant operations and foster team cohesion.
PreShifter is developed and operated by PRESHIFTER LLC, a company dedicated to creating innovative solutions for the restaurant industry. We aim to provide powerful, user-friendly tools for seamless restaurant team management and communication. PRESHIFTER LLC is a legally registered business with its principal place of business located at 418 Broadway, Suite 5958, Albany, NY 12207
By accessing and using the PreShifter app, you ("User") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). These Terms govern your use of the PreShifter app, including all content, features, and services it offers. If you disagree with these Terms, you may not access or use the PreShifter app.
By creating an account, either as an employee/teammate or an admin/restaurant owner, and using the services offered, you confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted these Terms. PRESHIFTER LLC reserves the right to modify, update, or replace any part of these Terms at its sole discretion. You will be notified of any changes, and your continued use of the app after such modifications signifies your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you disagree with any modifications, you should discontinue using the PreShifter app.
USER ELIGIBILITY AND ACCOUNT REGISTRATION
2.1 User Eligibility Criteria
To access and use the PreShifter app, users must be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in their jurisdiction to create an account and use the services provided by PreShifter. If you are under 18 years old, you may not register for an account or use the app. Users must comply with all applicable laws and regulations while using the app and must not use the app for any unlawful purposes.
The app is intended for use by restaurant industry employees, including, but not limited to, restaurant owners, managers, and staff members.
2.2 Account Creation and Responsibilities
To use the PreShifter app, users must create an account by providing accurate and complete information during registration. 
You must provide valid and up-to-date personal information, including your first and last name, username, email address, and other details as required by the app’s registration process. Inaccurate or incomplete information may result in suspension or termination of your account.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials, including your password. You agree to notify PreShifter immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other security breach. PRESHIFTER LLC is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account information.
Each user is permitted to have one account tied to their personal information. Admins and employees can only create multiple accounts for the same person if PreShifter authorizes them.
2.3 User Role Assignment and Management
PreShifter offers distinct roles with specific access permissions and functionalities:
a. Admin Role Creation: The account creator becomes the admin when creating or registering a restaurant within the PreShifter app. This role includes managing team members, editing or deleting content, approving or denying pre-shift items, and accessing additional management features. Only one admin can be per restaurant, and this role may only be transferred or reassigned with explicit permission from PreShifter.
b. Employee/Teammate Role: Individuals who join a restaurant team through an invite or approval by the admin assume the role of Employee/Teammate. This role provides access to key features, including viewing team chats, interacting with pre-shift and menu management functionalities, and contributing content. Employees are expected to use the app for restaurant-related purposes only and adhere to all usage guidelines established by the Admin.
c. Role Modifications and Termination: The Admin has full authority to modify user roles, approve or deny join requests, and suspend or terminate users’ access to the restaurant’s PreShifter account. Any changes to user roles must comply with these Terms and be made in good faith to facilitate operational efficiency and team collaboration.
SCOPE OF SERVICES
3.1 Team Admin Tools
The PreShifter app provides robust tools for Admins (typically restaurant owners or managers) to manage their restaurant teams effectively. These tools include:
a. User Management: Admins can search for employees who have created accounts with PreShifter by name. This search functionality provides results, including the employee’s image, first and last name, and username. Admins may invite employees to join the restaurant’s team or respond to join requests sent by employees.
b. Invitation Management: Admins can accept or decline employee requests to join the team. Once accepted, the employee becomes part of the admin’s team and gains access to various features of the PreShifter app.
c. Teammate Removal: Admins can remove employees from the team anytime, terminating their access to the restaurant’s content and app features.
3.2 Team Chat Features
The Team Chat operates as a centralized message board where all teammates, including the admin, can share text-based messages and images. All communications are visible to the entire team, with no one-to-one messaging functionality.
Admins can delete or clear the chat history to maintain an appropriate communication environment. Users are encouraged to engage respectfully and comply with the Acceptable Use Policy outlined in these Terms.
3.3 Pre-shift Builder Functionality
The Pre-shift Builder feature allows Admins to communicate daily operational updates and important information to their teams.
Admins can publish a range of pre-shift items, including—but not limited to—menu changes, section and table assignments, prep lists, staff schedules, reservation counts, point-of-sale updates, sales forecasts, policy changes, upcoming events, and other key announcements. Employees can view these items in real time.
Employees can submit their pre-shift items for consideration. The admin may approve or deny all submissions.
3.4 Menu Management Capabilities
Admins can create, read, update, and delete menu items. Menu item details include images, names, descriptions, prices, allergens, ingredients, and recipes. This comprehensive feature ensures that the restaurant’s menu remains current and easily accessible to all team members.
Employees can propose updates to menu items by creating, reading, or editing entries. All employee changes require Admin approval before being finalized and shared within the app.
SUBSCRIPTION, PAYMENTS, AND BILLING TERMS
4.1 Subscription Plans and Eligibility
The PreShifter app offers various subscription plans determining how many team members (“seats”) an Admin can add to their restaurant team. When an Admin creates a restaurant within the app, they can choose a subscription plan that matches the intended team size.
Users can select from monthly or annual plans at different price points. Current offerings include:
Monthly Plan: $79.99 per month for up to 20 seats.
Yearly Plan: $849.99 per year for up to 20 seats.
All subscriptions are managed via Apple’s App Store. Payments are processed using the payment method linked to the user’s Apple ID, and PRESHIFTER LLC does not handle or have direct access to payment details.
We reserve the right to adjust subscription rates or introduce new tiers. Any price changes will affect new subscriptions or renewals and will be communicated to current subscribers in accordance with App Store policies.
4.2 Payment Terms
Subscription fees must be paid in advance and are generally non-refundable unless otherwise required by law or outlined by Apple’s App Store policies.
By subscribing, you authorize Apple to charge the subscription fee to your Apple ID payment method at the start of each billing cycle. Subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel before the end of the current billing period.
Fees are listed in U.S. Dollars, but local currencies may be displayed depending on your region. The user is responsible for any additional fees or charges imposed by Apple, banks, or payment processors.
4.3 Automatic Renewal and Cancellation
Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the renewal date. You acknowledge that your payment method will be charged for renewal unless canceled in advance.
Users can cancel their subscriptions through their Apple ID settings. Once canceled, you will retain access to premium features until the end of the current billing period. Per App Store policy, refunds are not provided for any unused portion of the subscription period.
4.4 Changes to Subscription Plans
PRESHIFTER LLC reserves the right to modify subscription tiers, adjust seat limits, or update available features. Any changes will occur at the start of the next billing cycle or renewal. Existing subscribers will be informed of significant changes affecting their current plans or seat limits.
4.5 Free Trials and Promotions
We may provide free trials or limited-time promotional discounts on subscriptions. Such offers are subject to terms specified at the time and are valid for a limited duration. Free trials and discounts are generally limited to new users or those deemed eligible by PRESHIFTER LLC. Abuse or misuse of these offers may lead to cancellation or revocation.
If a free trial converts to a paid subscription, billing will commence automatically upon the trial's end unless canceled beforehand through Apple’s subscription management system.
4.6 Seat Limits and Overage Policies
Each subscription plan specifies the maximum number of team members (seats) an Admin can add. Attempts to exceed this limit may require upgrading to a higher-tier plan. In some cases, you may be able to add extra seats beyond your plan’s limit, subject to additional fees. Such fees will be charged at the end of the billing period.
If unauthorized seat additions are detected, PRESHIFTER LLC reserves the right to enforce appropriate changes, such as adjusting your plan or temporarily restricting access.


4.7 Refund Policy
All subscription payments are non-refundable unless otherwise required by applicable laws or specific App Store policies. Any refund inquiries should be directed to Apple’s App Store, as PRESHIFTER LLC does not process refunds directly for subscriptions managed through Apple.
4.8 Failed Payments and Subscription Suspension
If a subscription payment fails, Apple may attempt to process it again or notify you of the issue. Persistent payment issues may result in subscription termination and limited access to features.
Pay must be processed within 10 days of renewal to ensure your subscription is not canceled, leading to restricted access or potential data deletion.
4.9 Taxes
Unless explicitly stated, the fees listed do not include taxes such as VAT, sales tax, or other applicable charges. Taxes are applied according to Apple’s policies or relevant regulations.
4.10 Modifications to Billing and Payment Terms
PRESHIFTER LLC reserves the right to update billing and payment terms. Changes will be communicated with at least 30 days' notice before taking effect. If you disagree with the new terms, you may cancel your subscription through your Apple ID settings before the changes become active.
By subscribing, you agree to these terms governed by Apple’s App Store policies.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, PRESHIFTER LLC and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, and licensors shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages. This includes, but is not limited to, damages related to loss of profits, goodwill, data, or other intangible losses resulting from your use or inability to use the PreShifter app. This limitation of liability applies regardless of the origin of the claim, whether it arises from errors, bugs, interruptions, or technical malfunctions that impact the app's functionality or accessibility.
The limitations also cover any data loss or corruption stemming from the use of the app, including issues caused by technical failures, unauthorized access, or other security breaches.

Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain liabilities; therefore, some of these limitations may not apply to you.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
13.1 Dispute Resolution Process
In the event of a dispute arising out of or relating to the PreShifter app, these Terms of Service, or your use of our services, you agree to the following dispute resolution procedures:
You agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting PRESHIFTER LLC’s support team. Most user concerns can be quickly addressed through open communication and mutual understanding.
If the dispute cannot be resolved through informal means, it shall be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve disputes than a lawsuit in court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery, and is subject to limited review by courts. You and PRESHIFTER LLC agree that arbitration under these Terms will occur individually; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
The arbitration shall be conducted by a recognized arbitration organization mutually agreed upon by you and PRESHIFTER LLC, and it shall follow the rules and procedures of that organization. Arbitration shall occur at a mutually convenient location or, if no agreement is reached, at a location determined by the arbitrator. The costs of arbitration, including filing fees and arbitrator fees, shall be shared by both parties unless otherwise required by applicable law.
13.2 Class Action Waiver
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that any claims or disputes arising out of or relating to your use of the PreShifter app, these Terms of Service, or any related matter shall be resolved on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated, or representative action. Using the PreShifter app, you waive any right to participate in or bring class, collective, or representative actions against PRESHIFTER LLC.
If this class action waiver is deemed unenforceable or invalid, any class, collective, consolidated, or representative action may only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction and not through arbitration.
GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
These Terms of Service and any disputes or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law principles. In the event that arbitration is not required, or in any circumstances where litigation is permitted, you agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for legal proceedings arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the PreShifter app shall be the state and federal courts located in Albany County, New York.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and PRESHIFTER LLC waive any rights to a jury trial for any dispute arising from or related to these Terms or your app use.
SEVERABILITY AND WAIVER
If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable for any reason, that provision shall be deemed severable from the rest of these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The unenforceable provision will be modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable while maintaining the intent of the original provision.
The failure of PRESHIFTER LLC to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of PRESHIFTER LLC.
MODIFICATIONS TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE
PRESHIFTER LLC reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the PreShifter app or its services at any time without prior notice.
